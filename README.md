# Perlin Noise Generator

This project demonstrates the generation of Perlin noise using C# and SkiaSharp library to create textured patterns and images. Perlin noise is commonly used in computer graphics to create natural-looking textures, terrains, and other visual effects.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.

### Generating Simple Perlin Noise

1. Open the `Program.cs` file and modify the `width`, `height`, and `scale` parameters to adjust the image size and noise scale.
2. Run the program by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dotnet run
```
- The generated Perlin noise image will be saved as perlin_noise.png in the project directory.

# Generating Layered Perlin Noise:
- Open the Program.cs file and modify the layer properties in the layers array to adjust amplitude and frequency.
- Run the program by executing the following command in your terminal:
```
  dotnet run
```

- The generated layered Perlin noise image will be saved as layered_perlin_noise.png in the project directory.
